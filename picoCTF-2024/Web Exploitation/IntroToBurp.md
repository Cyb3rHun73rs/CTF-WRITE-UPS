# IntroToBurp
## Description
Try here to find the flag

Launch the challenge and click the provided link.

## Hints
1. Try using burpsuite to intercept request to capture the flag.
2. Try mangling the request, maybe their server-side code doesn't handle malformed requests very well.


## Approach
The challenge requires one to use burpsuite to intercept the traffic being sent to the server.Caido is another tool one can use https://caido.io/download.
When using burp, traffic can be captured using an add on proxy called foxy proxy or using the built in browser in burp.

Navigating to the link provided after launching the instance leads to a registration page.

fill the details and click register.A 2fa page loads afterwards.
Enter a random number in the otp field.

Bypassing 2fa is the goal of this challenge.At this stage you should turn the intercept option on in burp and refresh the 2fa page to allow burp to capture it.

Below is how to launch the built in burp browser.
