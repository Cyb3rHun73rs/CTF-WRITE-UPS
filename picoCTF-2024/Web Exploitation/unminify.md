# Unminify

## overview

* 100 points 

## Description
I don't like scrolling down to read the code of my website, so I've squished it. As a bonus, my pages load faster! Browse [here](http://titan.picoctf.net:52382/), and find the flag!

## Hints
1. Try CTRL+U / âŒ˜+U in your browser to view the page source. You can also add 'view-source:' before the URL, or try curl <URL> in your shell.
2. Minification reduces the size of code, but does not change its functionality.
3. What tools do developers use when working on a website? Many text editors and browsers include formatting.

## Approach

&rarr; The challenge, created by ***Jeffrey John***, is straightforward: it evaluates your proficiency in web tools and techniques by requiring you to analyze website source code to discover a hidden flag.

1. When you open the provided link, you'll encounter a webpage with a straightforward display


2. However, hidden within the source code of this page is a flag that you need to uncover.
   - **ctl + u** to view the page source
   
&rarr; You are presented with a lengthy string of text. Upon careful examination, the flag can be discovered within this line. Your task is to scrutinize the content thoroughly to locate the flag efficiently
